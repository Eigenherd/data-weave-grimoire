# Playground Spell

This spell will lanunch the playground UI. 
For the server is uses our  [data-weave-io](https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/data-weave-io) module. This module is still a POC but is fully functional right now.

The UI is being taken from [data-weave-playground-ui](https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/data-weave-playground-ui).

And uses our `dependency-managment` module to get this artifacts from the internet.

Enjoy your local self hosted data-weave playground. It is like MAGIC!
